Qarshi Medicine is based on the principles of Unani medicine, a system of healing that originated in ancient Greece and was developed by Muslim physicians. Unani medicine believes that health is a balance of four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) in the body. Any imbalance in these humors causes disease. Qarshi Medicine uses natural ingredients such as herbs, minerals, and animal products to restore the balance of humors and treat the root cause of the disease.
 
Qarshi Medicine is available in different forms, such as tablets, capsules, syrups, oils, creams, and powders. You can buy Qarshi Medicine online or from any Qarshi outlet in Pakistan.
