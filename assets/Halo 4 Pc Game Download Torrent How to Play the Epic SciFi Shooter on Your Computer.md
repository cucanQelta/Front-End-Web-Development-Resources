## What is Halo 4?
 
Halo 4 is a first-person shooter game that combines action, adventure, and sci-fi elements. It is set in the year 2557, four years after the events of Halo 3. The game follows the story of Master Chief, a super-soldier who wakes up from cryogenic sleep on a mysterious alien planet called Requiem. There, he encounters a new enemy faction called the Prometheans, who are controlled by an ancient evil known as the Didact. Master Chief must also deal with the deteriorating condition of his AI companion Cortana, who is suffering from rampancy.
 
The game features a single-player campaign mode that consists of 10 missions, as well as a multiplayer mode that includes various modes such as Slayer, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, and more. The game also introduces a new mode called Spartan Ops, which is a co-operative episodic mode that expands on the story of Halo 4.
